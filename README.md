# xs + Solid + Tauri == Stacks v2

This is a [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) / [Tauri 2.0
RC](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-2-0-0-release-candidate/) frontend for
[`xs`](https://github.com/cablehead/xs). The
[idea](https://github.com/cablehead/stacks/issues/58) is this will evolve to
become [Stacks](https://stacks.cross.stream).
